- i just finding some good manga to read
- just think will go through all company in hcm
- or remote, i not sure my english for communicate is okay for work with other guys
- So i think just apply for top company rank in hcm, and just go interview 
- I have some ideas to go somewhere, travel or just live alone with no money, nothings i can live with?
- see some people in internet "go to the wild"
- just see a random nerd, sit all day in front of computer, can really go to the wild
- no social skill at less can talk, can write, can think
- what the jobs fit to me, so when programming i can sit all day not eating
- i don't know more than one job can fit to me
- So right now just stay healthy and focus what i can to do in my faking life
