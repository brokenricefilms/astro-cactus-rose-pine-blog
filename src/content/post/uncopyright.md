This entire blog, and all my contents, are uncopyrighted.

That means I’ve put them in the public domain and released my copyright on all these works.

There is no need to email me for permission — use my content however you want! Email it, share it, and reprint it with or without credit. Change it around, put in a bunch of swear words, and attribute them to me. It’s OK.

Attribution is appreciated but not required.

I get the ideas from Leo Babauta: https://zenhabits.net
